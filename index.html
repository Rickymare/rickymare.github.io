            <p>Imagine a road made exclusively for bike commuters. Our population is on a significant rise. Our streets are no longer able to sustain the traffic and pollution caused by our American Dream.</p>
            <p>Roads that were exclusively for bikers would reduce congestion, improve air quality, and have proven to be effective in other countries.</p>
